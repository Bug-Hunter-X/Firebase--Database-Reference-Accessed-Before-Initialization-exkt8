# Firebase Database Initialization Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: accessing a database reference before it's fully initialized. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

**Problem:** Attempting to read or write data from the Firebase Realtime Database before the database reference is ready can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.  This is often exacerbated when working with authentication, as data access may depend on user authentication status. 

**Solution:** Ensure that database operations are performed only after the Firebase app and authentication have been successfully initialized.  This usually involves using promises or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the Firebase initialization process.
